                  It’s not every day we come across an application so cutting edge, so sophisticated, that just the thought of it triggers a flood of intrigue. When my team was asked to design an interface for NASA’s new time travel app, this is exactly what happened.

                  Pre-boarding
                </h2>
                <p>
                  Before diving into a solution, we sketched out some ideas. To develop a meaningful product, we needed to answer a number of questions. Some of the larger questions were:
                </p>
                <ol class='baseol'>
                  <li>
                    How could a time travel app actually work?
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    What kind of problems might arise with an app that allows people to travel through time? Is this safe?
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    How would people want to move through time?
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Is location important?
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    What happens if the phone dies?
                  </li>
                </ol>
              </div>
              <div class='col-md-1 col-lg-2'></div>
            </div>
            <div class='row'>
              <div class='col-lg-12'>
                <img class='img-responsive margin-auto margin-bottom' src='images/sketch_1.png'>
              </div>
            </div>
            <div class='row'>
              <div class='col-md-1 col-lg-2'></div>
              <div class='col-md-10 col-lg-8'>
                <p>
                  To start, we explored some ideas of moving through time. We landed on a “time map” concept. A map which would allow users to scroll through a detailed map of time. We set a range of about 5 billion years past to 5 billion years future - the putative lifespan of the earth. The map could develop over time, just like a map of the earth. As certain points became more fleshed out and explored, more information would become available. With the map, users could also “drop pins” in time, and have a clear understanding of exactly how far away they were traveling.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We were set on the idea of plugging in a location and seeing a visual indicator of where in time the user was going. A point-A-to-point-B feeling. As we continued to explore, we found this to be less important than originally thought.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We also developed an “extended calendar” approach where users could move through time much like they move through a calendar. After all, a calendar is a great way to track time. Ultimately though, the time map appeared to be a stronger concept, as it would allow users to zoom in and out more easily. Additionally, we were concerned that the repetition of a calendar-like interface might make the app feel boring.
                </p>

              <div class='col-md-1 col-lg-2'></div>

                <p>
                  Additional exploration yielded more problems. To combat the obvious issues of altering time, we developed an idea that made use of the
                  <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiverse' target='_blank'>
                    multiverse theory.
                  </a>
                  Users would be transported to one of the infinite number of parallel universes identical to ours. In this fashion, they could travel to an alternate universe, explore a moment in time, and return home to their “origin universe” - all without the risk of returning to an entirely different future. No “Back-to-the-Future” scenarios here! Let's be honest, no one likes to see themselves slowly fade out of family portraits...
                </p>
                <p>
                  This idea held up, until we started thinking about the repercussions of filling  other universes with time travel tourists. We're one unruly teenager away from chronological chaos!
                </p>
                <p>
                  As we pressed on, we asked ourselves:
                </p>
                <ol class='baseol'>
                  <li>
                    Why use this app?
                  </li>
                </ol>
              </div>
              <div class='col-md-1 col-lg-2'></div>
            </div>
            <div class='row'>
              <div class='col-lg-12'>
                <img class='img-responsive margin-auto margin-bottom' src='images/sketch_3.png'>
              </div>
            </div>
            <div class='row'>
              <div class='col-md-1 col-lg-2'></div>
              <div class='col-md-10 col-lg-8'>
                <p>
                  With the answer to this question came our solution. Any NASA based time travel app should be rooted in exploration. We want to harness the spirit of exploring moments in time, not manipulate time. With this mantra in hand, we developed a new concept:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  The app will beam users to a
                  <strong>
                    simulation
                  </strong>
                  of any moment in time. People can safely experience time, without affecting it.
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                  Our solution will allow users to explore the greatness of the past and future through virtual reality.
                </p>
              </div>
            </div>
            <div class='row'>
              <div class='col-lg-12'>
                <img class='img-responsive margin-auto margin-bottom' src='images/sketch_4.png'>
              </div>
            </div>
            <div class='row'>
              <div class='col-md-1 col-lg-2'></div>
              <div class='col-md-10 col-lg-8'>
                <p>
                  From here, we explored the interface and developed the idea of “moments”. A moment is a location + a time. Through the app, moments could be searched, curated, categorized and most importantly, EXPLORED. Something like “the Air BnB of time” with direct access to any location.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The app will allow people to simulate any moment in time with a simple search. The simulation is 100% realistic and folks can stay as long as they want. Also, the “beam transportation device” keeps user’s phones charged, so no need to worry about getting stuck.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The app remains active while “in flight”. Users can easily search for a new moment to travel to, or return home at any time.
                </p>

                <p>
                  With a clear understanding of how the app will work, we needed NASA to provide a little more info. We asked them a few questions so we could best solve their problem. Here’s what we got back:

                          <p>
                            NASA has had the means to travel through time for quite a while now. We have been documenting, in detail, every earthly moment roughly 5 billion years in the past to 5 billion years in the future (between the formation of the earth and the destruction of the sun).
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            Exploration has always been core to NASA’s mission. In turn, we would like to allow the public to explore these moments just as we have. To do so, we have developed technology that simulates traveling to a point in time through a satellite based “beaming mechanism”. Our app will allow people to beam to a simulation of any moment they please. The app is totally safe and totally free!

                            We expect our initial audience to be intelligent, tech savvy people. We want to target good natured people that will use the gift of time-travel to explore, rather than use it for personal gain. Anyone caught using the app for anything other than exploration will be banned.

We want to create an experience that mimics “searching for a picture” or “entering a location into a GPS”. The app should feel familiar right out of the gate.

We have discussed a “parental control” or “rating” feature to limit access to certain moments. We have also made some moments “unsearchable” due to their graphic nature. Access to these moments is granted by special request only.

                            Currently, we offer users the ability to simulate any point in time they wish, within the lifespan of the earth.

                            To start, NASA will feed a range of interesting moments into the system, broken down into categories for the user to explore. Users can also search for any moment they wish.

                            A moment consists of a:
                            <ul>
                              <li>
                                time
                              </li>
                              <li>
                                date
                              </li>
                              <li>
                                location (exact address or general place)
                              </li>
                            </ul>
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            The simulation is 100% realistic. Users will feel exactly as if they are there. The experience can be described as “ghost like”, where users can see and hear their surroundings, but the surroundings do not see them.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            While “in simulation” users can continue to use the app to see their current moment in time, search for their next location or return home.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            This is an MVP, and we plan to quickly allow travel deeper into the past and future.

                          </p>
                          <ul>
                            <li>
                              commenting on a moment

                            <li>
                              dropping pins to return to later
                            </li>
                            <li>
                              user generated moment feeds.

                  While researching other time travel interfaces, we came across some great thinking. We noticed however, a lot of the designs were “futuristic” looking. Per NASA’s request to keep the app friendly, an approachable solution was always in the back of our minds.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We remember hearing that many “sci-fi” interfaces in movies and shows were intentionally designed to look “complex” and “involved”. These were two feelings we wanted to avoid.

                  NASA uses helvetica as their primary typeface. It’s designed to work well in any situation, and is very close to Apple’s system typeface: San Francisco, which was modeled closely from helvetica. We decided to use helvetica as the typeface for both platforms. It is neutral enough to make both IOS and Android demographics feel at home. We set the text on the larger side, so all users, young and old, are able read the information on the pages (without having to resort to their reading glasses). While smaller text looks nice, accessibility is something NASA deemed important.

                  , we added vertical type to the category cells. We choose to display the “moment count” here, as we have relative control over the length of the label. This is the first screen users will see, so  it was a great opportunity to project the essence of NASA right out of the gate.

                  In addition to typography, we aimed to surface the brand through color. We researched the color guidelines and began assigning meaning to color use:
                </p>

                  </li>
                  <li style='color:#0064B6!important;'>
                    <strong>
                      Blue:
                    </strong>
                    accents
                  </li>

                    <strong>
                      Gray/Black:

                </ol>
                <p>
                  With our color system in place, we applied it to the designs. We added some subtle stars, influenced by the NASA logo. Whether or not the star treatment will be a success remains to be seen.

                  Per our outlines in the discovery phase, we designed the search functionality to be quick and easy. Early on, we explored surfacing categories here. After some testing however, we removed the categories in favor of coach marks for the search field. In future iterations of the app, we expect to extend the search functionality to include things like user generated categories and additional moments in time. Because we moved away from fixed date input fields, the search bar can evolve as the app does.

                <p>
                  Moments are core to the app concept. Making them look interesting in a listview turned out to be somewhat of a challenge. To get them looking just right, we went through a few rounds of color treatments. While we made progress, we feel we're not there yet.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Like locations in a map app, more fleshed out moments will surface supporting images. Newer or less explored moments will fall back to a default coordinate treatment, displaying a visualization of where the moment sits in time. To start, only moments curated by NASA will have images and descriptions. Eventually, we will add the ability for anyone to add to moments.

                  Building on  our NASA-red action color, we choose to incorporate a large red button to initiate warping. Many of us have an innate child-like desire to “push a big red button”. We decided to play off this emotion to add some delight to the app. In future iterations, we feel we can add some exciting UX to really drive home a feeling of joy here. Perhaps a pleasurable sound or a long press build up that would also act as a “confirm”.

                  A quick note on the iPhone menu
                </h2>
                <p>
                  Apple prefers their apps use a fixed bottom nav bar to navigate. We explored this idea, but ultimately went with a slide-in menu. We did this to support the accessibility of the “Take Me Home” action. While we would have preferred to use the tab bar, we didn't want the two to compete. Perhaps in the future, we can find a more viable solution.
